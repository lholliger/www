# Holliger.me

Here's my new website, rewritten in Rust instead of being some Wordpress site. Inspiration taken from [Haylin's](https://github.com/haylinmoore/www) site.

If you want to use this for yourself, you mostly just need to redo the "images", "content", and the "root.rs" file to swap out everything. Perhaps I'll make some things more modular to make it easier to fork.

Hopefully I update this site unlike the last one! A bit more fun when I have to maintain everything instead of just making posts.
